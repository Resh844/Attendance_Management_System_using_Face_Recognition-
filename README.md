# Attendance_Management_System_using_Face_Recognition-
<p><pre>This project addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies associated with traditional attendance management systems, which often rely on manual or card-based methods. Such systems are prone to issues like proxy attendance, time wastage, and errors in record maintenance. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated Attendance Management System using Face Recognition technology.</pre>
<pre>The objective of this project is to design and implement a system that ensures accurate and efficient attendance tracking by leveraging advanced facial recognition techniques. The system captures and processes facial images of students during attendance sessions, matches them against a pre-registered database, and records attendance in real-time.</pre>
<pre>The methodology involves utilizing a deep learning-based approach for face detection and recognition, implemented using Python and OpenCV. The system integrates a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to identify and authenticate faces. Key phases of the project include dataset creation, model training, system development, and rigorous testing.</pre>
<pre>The results demonstrate a high level of accuracy, with the system achieving good accuracy of 98% recognition under varied conditions such as lighting and facial expressions. Additionally, the system significantly reduces the time required for attendance marking, enhancing overall classroom management efficiency.</pre>
<pre>In conclusion, the Attendance Management System using Face Recognition offers a reliable and scalable solution to modernize attendance tracking in educational institutions. Future enhancements could include integration with institution-wide systems, multi-camera setups for larger classrooms, and enhanced security features to prevent misuse.</pre>
